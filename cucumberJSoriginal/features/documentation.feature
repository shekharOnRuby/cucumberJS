Feature: Example feature

    As a user of Cucumber.js
    I want to have documentation on Cucumber
    So that I can concentrate on building awesom applicaitons.

    Scenario: Reading Documentation
    Given I am on the Cucumber.js GitHub repository
    When I click on "CLI"
    Then I should see "Running specific features"
